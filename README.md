<h2>About Me</h2>
Hey, im 17 years old Batch Developer who dreams of creating Minecraft Copy at some point. I like to create games in batch, and all kinds of systems. My most recent project is Gem Miner 2 which is sequel to [Gem Miner 1](https://github.com/Fisterkoo/Gem-Miner-v1.2-Technical-Update-II) ,but because the code of Gem Miner 1 was very messy i decided to instead make a sequel. I engage in Batch Scripting for about a year now and i would call myself a pretty experienced guy when it comes to Batch.
