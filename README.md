Hey, im 17 years old Batch Developer who dreams of creating Minecraft Copy at some point. I like to create games in batch, and all kinds of systems. My most recent project is Gem Miner 2 which is sequel to Gem Miner 1 ,but because the code of Gem Miner 1 was very messy i decided to instead make a sequel. I engage in Batch Scripting for about a year now and i would call myself a pretty experienced guy when it comes to Batch.
